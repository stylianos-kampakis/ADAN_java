/**
 * ExecutionCommander is a parent class that other commanders inherit from.
 * The Commander classes are used in order to facilitate the interaction of the kieSession with the
 * rest of the platform.
 * 
 * Each commander is used in order to store information that has been produced by the kieSession. This information
 * can then be used to execute various actions. See specific implementations (e.g. ImputationCommander) for examples.
